# csgoconfig
This repo consists of my csgo config files :))))))

Just paste the .cfg files in *$\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg* folder and you are good to go.

Remember to type *exec wasim* in console to execute my config 

*zprac.cfg* is my practice server config. 
Just run *exec zprac.cfg* as soon as you start a map.
